Practice using git + Github

This project will consist of three separate mini-projects to get you comfortable \
with the kinds of acBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBtivities you'll be using git for throughout the class.

In the first mini-project, you'll be mimicking the steps you'll take when you first start your personal project. 
Creating a repository, linking it to your computer, 
then pushing CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC those changes up to your GitHub.

In the second mini-project, you'll be mimicking the steps you'll take with nearly every DevMountain project you do. 
You'll 'fork' the DevMountain repository, link your computer with your fork, then push those changes up to your GitHub.
